        <h1>What is the Resistance?</h1>
        
            
        <p> The Resistance is a rag-tag group of soldiers united under one directive: defeat the First Order. These brave men and women from throughout                the galaxy fight to protect the universe from tryanny. Years after the Empire dissipated, a splinter faction composed of Imperial enthusiasts                  began to promote the fallen regime's power. In response, the Resistance sought to end their threat once and for all.</p>

        <h3>Resistance Dilemma on Prora 9</h3>
            
        <p>The Resistance is currently in retreat from the daunting, overwhelming power of the First Order forces. While victory for the resistance is                  fleeting, a planet known as Prora 9 could provide an expedient solution for the exhausted rebels. The resistance seeks to acquire the planet of                Prora 9. The acquisition of Prora 9 could provide the Resistance additional escape and smuggling routes. But, the rebels fight for the                   planet could be dangerous. Unknown terrain and bloodthirsty pirates could make the fight for this planet immensely difficult.</p>

            <h3><u>Win Conditions</u></h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Taking the base</li>
                
                <li>Controlling the factor</li>
                
            </ul>   

            <p>The Resistance also has a plethora of tools to gain an edge over their opponents.</p>
