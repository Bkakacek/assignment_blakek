            <p>Initially, the First Order was comprised of the remnants of the Galactic Empire in the Unknown Regions<br /> of the 
            galaxy. After the fall of the Galactic Empire, the remaining members of the Empire waited around three years<br /> to assemble 
            a strong enough force to pose a threat. The First Order aimed to reinstate the ideals of the Galactic Empire,<br /> but the increased number of members              allowed the splinter group to become its own faction.</p>

            <h3>First Order Dilemma on Prora 9</h3>
            
            <p>The First Order is in pursuit of the Resistance forces who have charted a course to a jungle planet<br /> known as Prora 9. A victory over the                      Resistance could provide a significant advantage over the enemy. Acquiring the planet<br /> of Prora 9 could provide the First Order with a new                      factory to produce updated weaponry, and another planet would expand<br /> the First Order's empire.</p>
            
            <h3>**Side Note**</h3>
            
            <p> Many people have noted the similarity between Nazi Germany and the First Order in the film <em>The Force Awakens.</em> The author claims that First                   Order is inspired by the theory of ODESSA.</p>

            <p>The First Order has the capacity to decimate the Resistance on Prora 9.</p>
