    <h1>What is the First Order?</h1>
    
    <article> Not the good guys!!</article>
            
            <p>Initially, the First Order was comprised of the remnants of the Galactic Empire in the Unknown Regions of the 
            galaxy. After the fall of the Galactic Empire, the remaining members of the Empire waited around three years to assemble 
            a strong enough force to pose a threat. The First Order aimed to reinstate the ideals of the Galactic Empire, but the increased number of members                    allowed the splinter group to become its own faction.</p>

            <h3>First Order Dilemma on Prora 9</h3>
            
            <p>The First Order is in pursuit of the Resistance forces who have charted a course to a jungle planet<br /> known as Prora 9. A victory over the                      Resistance could provide a significant advantage over the enemy. Acquiring the planet<br /> of Prora 9 could provide the First Order with a new                      factory to produce updated weaponry, and another planet would expand<br /> the First Order's empire.</p>
            
            
            <h3>Win Conditions</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Wipe out the pirates.</li>
                <li>Defeat the Resistance.</li>
                <li>Control the factory.</li>
            </ul> 

            <p>The First Order has the capacity to decimate the Resistance on Prora 9.</p>
