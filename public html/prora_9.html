<p><em><B>The story so far... </B></em></p>

<p>Prora 9 is a jungle planet that is home to a clone wars era droid factory that came into the possession of a pirate faction called
Mechanized Hydra. The Mechanized Hydra had acquired a substantial amount of 'lost' vessels and used them to put together a functioning
starbase that has been producing an autonomous warfleet using altered battle droids. Over time, the activies between the resistance and
the first order had picked up a few SOS transmissions, civilian and military, which drew in the resistance and the first order.<p>

<p>A small insertion team composed of resistance members and a fleet of the first order make haste to follow the signals and find the hydra horde.<p>

<h1><u>Game mechanics:</u></h1>

<p>Prora 9 has a variety of possible dangerous wildlife since the clone wars had finished. GM's who would run this campaign are encouraged to add in 
unique creatures from any official star wars creature list or generator. Custom made creatures outside of the official star wars creature list may 
add unique threats to make encounters more interesting. Each faction will get a benefit to deal with these dangerous creatures but players are
encouraged to come up with ideas to defeat the creatures for survival as the conflict drags on.</p>

<p>A vanilla Prora 9 (the original campaign) would have predators that are augmented by the pirates' long stand hold with the battledroids and their
modifications. There are even failed or escaped experiments which could employ a blaster on its back to being a living bomb. There is one apex 
predator that dominates the planet with secondary and tertiary apex creatures by powers of two.</p>

<h2><u>History:</u></h2>

<p>Prora 9 is the 9th planet of the Prora system. It was originally a outer rim world until the Galatic Empire had been formed and removed the CIS threat
from the galaxy. The factory on the planet only remains because a CIS tactics droid had understood the war was over and ceased production of CIS battle
droids. Since then the planet had grown well over the factory, however, the factory was able to produce maintenance droids to keep its systems running
while the nature grew around them.</p>

<p>The pirates had came into the system after the Galatic Empire fell to the rebel forces at the end of the battle of Endor. The pirates chose the location
because of how easy it is to snipe ships for their cargo since it was a frequent enough transport route. The current leader, titled Void Drogos, runs the
factory currently with several battalions of unique battledroids since the first Void Drogos had operated the factory from the ground up before passing on.</p>
