When a background color is defined, consider also defining a
foreground color (by using the "color" property). This helps
to avoid conflict with user-defined style sheets and to
improve accessibility. This message is displayed up to 5

[CSE] Warning number 1 in line 49:10:
Many mobile devices use touch screens making ":hover"
problematic, cumbersome, or impossible to use. Depending on
the browser, ":hover" might never match, or it might match
for brief moments, or until the user touches another
element. Ensure that content is never only accessible or
only visible by hovering. This message is displayed only
once.

[CSE] Comment number 1:
[73] Section 508 accessibility checking is off.

[CSE] Comment number 2:
[73] WCAG 1.0 accessibility checking is off.

[CSE] Comment number 3:
[73] WCAG 2.0 accessibility checking is off.

[CSE] Comment number 4:
Accessibility checking is off. This program can help you
make your web pages more accessible. An accessible page is
one that more individuals can use, such as individuals who
are blind or deaf. It can also increase the usefulness of
your web page for individuals who browse the web using
slower devices like older computers or wireless devices like
mobile phones and PDAs. An accessible web site makes good
business sense (and possibly good legal sense as well) and
may even improve search engine rankings. You can enable or
disable accessibility checking in the Validator Engine
Options.

[CSE] Comment number 5:
