	<h1>Pirates</h1>

        <div class="row">
        	<div class="col-md-6">
				Pirates are your people who are in it for the payoff. A life of combat, crime, and freedom in your efforts put in to get what you want without any regard to others around you except your crew. In this setting the pirate faction is named the Mechanical Hydra. These pirates are more tech savvy than your average run and gun smash and grab group. These people have a leader titled the Void Drogos as their boss. The person who holds the title controls the planet, or most of what is tamed from a wild piece of nature that is Prora 9.
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-6">
				As the pirate faction you play defender of the planet from the Resistance and First Order. Your primary goal is to prevent the other two factions from capturing or destroying your base of operations in the worst way possible, for without your autonomous factory you lose out on your great horde of looted ships and resources.
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>Players playing the pirate faction can join in from outside of the system through a local recruiter, are already born into, or hired from the black market. Players get to have the option of playing all possible races and gear they can build into. Force sensitive characters can play in the faction too, however, they cannot be trained in any of the usual force sensitive equipment and combat styles; such as a lightsaber.</p>

		<p>Players will have options to be part of the space or ground forces at different ranks underneath the Void Drogos. Real lucky players can even be the second-in-command. The players who take roles of base building can design assets and build them within a given time determined by the Game Master or by the roll of a dice; the number representing months. This is to give players the feel of affecting the game and, should they continue to use this campaign, can launch a galatic conquest of their own!</p>

		<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
			At the bottom line for official end game victory the Resistance must be driven off system or killed, and the First Order must be repelled from their invasion.
		</div>

		<p>The base of the pirates is combined with a droid factory where players can spend time designing a battledroid type with limitations. Most of these designs will follow official rules from SWRPG sources or negotiated with the GM for different experiences. There is also a space station where the pirates hold their grip on the world and production of a starfleet occurs.</p>

		<p>Players can add buildings within time allowed by the GM and if any buildings are incomplete they will be left as potential cover or material assets for any faction to control. An example of a situation like this would be a planetary to space gun system can be hijacked by Resistance forces to assist and eventually destroy both factions in the space battle or the First Order can disable the asset through bombartment or invasion.</p>

		<p>The starfleet of the pirates hold onto a primary flagship, The Nexus, which is a droid control center core of a lucherhulk-class starship meshed together with an old mandalorian starship. The ship boasts enough of a size to be considered a battleship. This ship is meant to combat any possible large vessels the First Order may bring for their assault on Prora 9. Players are able to add any class of starships the help assist the protection of the big asset and forming a blockcade that can prevent Resistance forces from sneaking in.</p>

		<p>Please consult your official SWRPG and GM to agree on a fair allowance for resources. We reconmend a credit pool of several million for the use of building and improving characters for a tough fight. The pirate faction is more free for building and homebrew designs to make the game much more fun to play.</p>
