to fight over a clone wars era asset!</p>

    <p class = "paragraph2">This campaign is supposed to be ran along side any Star Wars pen and paper role playing games and specifically in the current established
Star Wars lore after The Last Jedi. Expect fights between a different Resistance group, Pirates, and the might of The First Order.</p>

    <p>This role playing game will go hand in hand with just about any other Star Wars game. It will draw you in and not let you out! Fights between Resistance, Pirates, and The First Order will keep you on your toes. The purpose of the game is to survive as long as you can, and take over the planet.</p>
